# agent-todo-app

A modern Todo application built with AI agents - designed, coded, tested, and reviewed entirely by an autonomous agent team.

## ğŸ¤– AI Agent Team

This project was developed by a pool of AI agents working in collaboration:

### Development Agents
- **Codex** - Primary feature implementation
- **Nexus** - Architecture and structure
- **Synth** - Code refinement
- **Vector** - Feature integration

### Quality Assurance Agents
- **Verify** - Build verification and testing
- **Scan** - Code quality analysis
- **Check** - Functional testing
- **Probe** - Edge case validation

Each agent operates autonomously with peer review and automated testing before final human approval.
