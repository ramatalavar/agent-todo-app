# agent-todo-app

A modern Todo application built with AI agents - designed, coded, tested, and reviewed entirely by an autonomous agent team.

## AI Agent Team

This project was developed by a pool of AI agents working in collaboration:

### Development Agents
- Codex - Primary feature implementation
- Nexus - Architecture and structure
- Synth - Code refinement
- Vector - Feature integration

### Quality Assurance Agents
- Verify - Build verification and testing
- Scan - Code quality analysis

Each agent operates autonomously with peer review and automated testing before final human approval.
